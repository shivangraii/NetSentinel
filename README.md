# üîê NetSentinel: Secure Network Access & Monitoring using Cisco Packet Tracer

**NetSentinel** is a simulated secure network infrastructure built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It implements core enterprise networking principles such as:

- **AAA with TACACS+** for centralized user authentication
- **Syslog Server** for real-time event logging
- **NetFlow** for network traffic monitoring and analysis
- **Switch-based LAN** topology with end-device connectivity

This project mirrors real-world network practices to provide a secure, scalable, and observable LAN environment.
